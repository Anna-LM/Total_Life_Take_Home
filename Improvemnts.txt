Improvements/To Do:


Validation - 
    On user inputs
        Patient and Clinicians selected from drop down
        Search by clinician/patient name not just ID
        Update field for clinician details would interact with registry
    SQL 
        Injections
        Consistency i.e. cant delete a doctor if has appointments
        Unique i.e. patient Details/appointments


Error Messages - 
    More informative error Messages
    Include Error Codes i.e. 404, 200, 503 etc

End Points -
    Include more of the end points in the front end
    Better validation on end points

Code Structure -
    Separate pages/react endpoints for the different searches (i.e. http://localhost:3001/patients )
    Separate Code into different files
    Reduce code redundnacy by creating more objects and methods for repeated/similar sections and removing unused variables/functions
    Documentation, inline and external
    
Other - 
    Import SQL entities from txt or elsewhere in initiation
